This is an official source distribution of SysBar/2.

The source code has been made open in hope that there are still people
interested in investing their time and resources in this product further
development. The use and distribution conditions are covered in the
license agreement found in the LICENSE file or any program source file.

I would like to retain the copyright on any code in this package written
by me, graphics, software architecture, user interface concepts, and the
"SysBar" and "SysBar/2" product names. Some code is contributed by Sergey
I. Yevtushenko and remains of his property. I would also appreciate
notifying me about further product development, new releases and other
products derived from the SysBar/2 codeline.

See the "!Distribute!" directory for product documentation and the latest
build of the software. Other directories contain project source files,
images, resources and makefiles. To build the software you need OS/2
Toolkit 3.0 or later and Watcom C/C++ 10.5 or later. To open the project
in the Watcom IDE, open the sysbar2.wpj file from the root source
directory.

The project in its current state might contain unfinished or half-broken
features, such as enhanced filtering in Task Switcher, and others. I leave
it up to the developers to finish or disable those.
